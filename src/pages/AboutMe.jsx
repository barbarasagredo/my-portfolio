              I consider myself a creative and brave person. I moved to New
              Zealand this year and even though I had to come back I was able to
              prove myself âœ¨ I can speak englishâœ¨
            </p>
            <p> I'm an analog photographer ðŸ“· </p>
            <p>
              My biggest goal is to become into a mobile applications dev, now I
              am learning Flutter ðŸ’Ž
            </p>
            <p>
              Better in an inclusive company where I can learn and develop my
              potential, drink coffee and share music with my co-workers ðŸŽ§
            </p>
